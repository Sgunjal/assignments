1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 344 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.
How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?

Ans:- 
This approach is misleading because if you check number of people followed by Jill Stein and Gary Johnson  are 4155 and 3123 respectively where Hillary Clinton and Donal Trump  follows 748 and 42 people respectively. As Jill Stein and Gary Johnson follows more people there will be more overlap of friends between them which cannot quantify that they are more similar.  
This problem can be solved by using Jaccard index. Jaccard index can be used for comparing similarity of sample test data.
Formula: -   J(X, Y) = |X Intersection Y| / |X Union Y |
		  = |X Union Y|/ |X| + |Y| - |X Intersection Y|

          To fix this we have to calculate percentage of common friends between Jill Stein, Gary Johnson  and Hillary Clinton ,Donald Trump . Then we have to subtract there percentage (Jill Stein -Gary Johnson  ) say x and (Hillary Clinton - Donald Trump) say y. Then we can compare these two differences. Lesser the difference more similar they are.
Example:-  
Note:- Calculations as per latest data 

Jill Stein = ((349/4155)*100)
	= 8.39
Gary Johnson= ((349/3123)*100)
	          = 11.75
X= 11.75-8.39
 X =2.78
Hillary Clinton=((1/748)*100)	 
	           =0.13
Donal Trump=((1/42))	         
	         = 2.38
Y=2.38-0.13
Y = 2.25

As we can see X>Y means Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are more similar than Jill Stein and Gary Johnson as they have less difference.




2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.

Ans:- 

Magic Johnson is famous basketball player and many people know him. Magic Johnson is a supporter of the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton is its nominee for presidential campaign He has also hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on August 22, 2016. As magic Johnson is supported of Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton is its nominee for 2016 presidential election hence Hillary Clinton follows magic Johnson. 
Magic Johnson loves trump hotels and he is good friends of Donald trump that is the reason trump follow him on twitter as this will help him to get attention from public and can get more votes in presidential election.



3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?

Ans:-
Gary Earl Johnson is an American businessman, author, politician, and the Libertarian Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2016 election and Donald Trump is the Republican Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2016 election. As Donald Trump is famous personality he does not follow more people while Gary Earl Johnson is not as famous as Donald Trump hence follows more people to get attention from public. 
     	This will affect our analysis as we are calculating how often each friend is followed as Gary Earl Johnson follows more people there will be more common friends between them and friend_overlap will return more overlapping friends with other candidates as he follows more people.


4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?

Ans:-
